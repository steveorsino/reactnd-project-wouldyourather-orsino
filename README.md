# Would you rather...? Project - Stephen Orsino

This is the second project for Udacity's React Nonodegree curriculum.  This app uses React and Redux to let users play a "Would you rather?" game. Users may log in, log out, vote on questions, submit new questions, and view a leaderboard of all users to see where they rank in terms of total asked and answered questions.
